This is an official implementation of our NeurIPS 2022 paper "Bridging the Gap Between Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Small Datasets".


The author is busy working on the upcoming CVPR currently. The full version of code including training script will be released a few days after the deadline of CVPR (maybe in the late November). If readers would like to re-implement the modules now, please refer to the Appendix of the paper.
